# Skurt Challenge



The simplest way to run this source code is to download the files and then open Android Studio and an emulator and then import the project via the gradle file. You could also import via Git.

If you simply want to run the project, then you can just open the .apk file.

This is a simple protoype that allows you to query your FlightStats flight number and easily order a Skurt to be there upon your arrival.
